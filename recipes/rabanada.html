            <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>Rabanada is a sweet very common in Brazil during Christmas. There are many variations of this plate aroun the world, like french toast in the US and <em>pain perdu</em> in France. Even though people usually tend to think that rabanada comes from Portugal, it's probably from France or at least has French influence. Another interesting fact is that in the 15th century rabanadas used to be given to women after they gave birth.</p>
